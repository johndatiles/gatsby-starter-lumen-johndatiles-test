### About Me
I was raised in the Bay Area, graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Civil Engineering, then worked 7 years for Caltrans. 

During that time, I met, married, and followed a Maui girl to Oahu. I've since found meaningful work as a Civil Engineer for the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources ([DLNR](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/)).

I'm a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), registered in both California and Hawaii.

This website is a way for me to practice writing, learn code, share ideas, and document my life. More on that in my first blog post [here](posts/why-im-starting-a-blog).

Feel free to reach out to me [@johndatiles](https://twitter.com/johndatiles) on Twitter.

### What I'm Doing Now
Acclimating to my new role as a parent with my wife Bianca.

Getting back to a writing habit.
