## 1. Improve My Writing

Think of the ways you write. You probably do at least one of the following every day: email, text, DM, or comment on social media. Writing is fundamental. These days, working from home, I’m writing a lot more emails.

After pressing send I often ask myself, *did that make sense?* Or think, *that was too wordy*. My email needs to be clear to do my job effectively. Writing emails every day helps me improve.

But I don't get much practice with personal writing. I journal, but the only reader for that is me. Often it’s an unstructured vomit of words.

Writing on a blog forces me to organize my thoughts. Readers need to understand my overall message. (If I’m being honest, my wife will probably be the only one reading this. With a sprinkle of family and friends.)

The main reason for starting this blog is to improve my writing—by practicing, then practicing, and practicing some more.

## 2. Stretch My Creative Muscle

Sharing ideas I want to expand on requires imagination.

Creating something tangible out of my thoughts requires invention.

Writing about a myriad of topics gives me the freedom to experiment and play with words.

I consume a lot of content on the internet. I also want to create. Starting a blog helps me do that.

## 3. Learn to Code

When I was younger, my brother and I would make websites for fun. We loved exploring the funky digital spaces of the internet’s early days, full of neon colors, visitor counters, and spinning text. It inspired us to create our own. Reminiscing on that reminded me of how *fun* it was.

There are services out there that create websites for you, but I enjoy understanding the code behind the website.

I’m building on my previous experience by learning JavaScript and Gatsby.js to build a static website (meaning no fancy databases or content management systems, e.g., WordPress).

At the time of this post, I’m using the Gatsby Lumen Starter template that I slightly customized. The plan is to build this anew as I learn more about coding.

## 4. Own My Content

I use social media like most. But I don’t know where those platforms will be in 10 or 20 years. Will Instagram still be around? Or will everyone move somewhere else?

Writing on Medium is popular. I’ll probably even repost my writing there for the social reach. But it wouldn’t technically be mine.

Having this blog means I own it.

## 5. Step Outside My Comfort Zone
Writing this to post publicly is uncomfortable. Most things you do for the first time are. First job interview. First time riding a motorcycle. First time moving across the country.

The beginning is hard. It’s also the start of a fuller life.

Uncomfortable situations help you grow. It’s healthy to step outside your comfort zone.

## 6. Share Ideas
With a blog I can write about ideas and thoughts I think are worth sharing.

Topics include books I’ve read, project management strategies I use at work, Hawaii, coding, productivity, and the list goes on.

It’s a way to connect and hopefully provide value to others from my small corner of the internet.

## 7. Document My Life
This blog documents my life. It’s part of all the photos I take, videos I record, and journaling I write. All which tell my story.

We all document our lives. It’s a way to remember.

In the end, what I write here is really for myself. For future me to read the thoughts of past me and reflect. It’ll be interesting to see how my writing improves (or worsens), what the website will look like, and who I’ve become.

Writing is like telepathy. As a reader, you’re transported into the mind of the writer.

Hello future me. What do you think so far?
