>"When did you feel like you'd become a man?" Wes asked me, a troubled look on his face. ... When did I actually become a man? There was no official ceremony that brought my childhood to an end. Instead, crises or other circumstances presented me with adult-sized responsibilities and obligations that I had to meet one way or another. (Page 66)

This was the first book I read for Steph Curry's book club, [Underrated](https://twitter.com/stephencurry30/status/1296168620192538624?lang=en). I enjoyed thought-provoking discussions with other readers. Steph's questions and insights were also great.

To retain more of what I read, I'm trying something new here: book notes.

Usually, I highlight a bunch of what I'm reading. But it's rare that I go back and read those highlights. And even when I do, each highlight feels disconnected from an overall takeaway I had for that particular book. So I'm writing these notes to structure those thoughts and reflections. 

I imagine these will also help when people ask what I'm reading or books I recommend.

Here are my notes on The Other Wes Moore (spoiler-free until the 'Summary and Notes' section). More book info on its Goodreads [page](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7099273-the-other-wes-moore).

## A Short Summary
Two stories of two kids both named Wes Moore. Both born within a year of each other. Both from Baltimore, both with tough childhoods. One ends up successful, while the other ends up in prison. The author shares stories from interviews with the other Wes Moore, contrasting those with his own.

## Impressions
Throughout the book, I had so many questions. How did the environment these two kids live in shape their future? How did those who nurtured them guide them on the paths they would take? What was the difference, and where did their paths diverge?

## Who Should Read It?
Recommended to anyone who wants insight into the lives of black youth; how their environment can be an obstacle and how those around them can set them up for success. 

>The basketball court is a strange patch of neutral ground, a meeting place for every element of a neighborhood's cohort of young men. ... We were all enclosed by the same fence, bumping into one another, fighting, celebrating. Showing one another our best and worst, revealing ourselves-even our cruelty and crimes-as if that fence had created a circle of trust. A brotherhood. (Page 44)

## Reflections
A child's environment impacts who they grow into. The author was surrounded by drugs and vandalism -- he could have went down that path. But he had positive adult figures that overcame the negativity and set him on a path to success. Even more impactful to a child's growth are the people that raise them.

While reading the story of both Wes Moore's, I reflected on my own childhood. I had good teachers and my parents strived to raise me well.

I also thought of mentors into my 20's. Those mentors were often peers or, like my brother -- younger than me. This story reminded me that while we each have a personal responsibility for our own lives, we are shaped by the people around us. Our successes can be linked to another's acts, from after school tutoring, to words of encouragement -- our success is the success of others.

In a child's journey to adulthood, individuals have a far greater impact than environment. Those around you can help push you to succeed, help you ignore the negative influences around you, and act as a lighthouse to show you a path to success.

>What changed was that I found myself surrounded by people -- starting with my mom, grandparents, uncles, and aunts, and leading to a string of wonderful role models and mentors -- who kept pushing me to see more than what was directly in front of me, to see the boundless possibilities of the wider world and the unexplored possibilities within myself. People who taught me that no accident of birth -- not being black or relatively poor, being from Baltimore or the Bronx or fatherless -- would ever define or limit me. In other words, they helped me to discover what it means to be free. (Page 179)

## Summary and Notes
### **<span style = "color: #ff8c00;"> Spoilers below. Please skip if you plan on reading the book.</span>**

### Part I - Fathers and Angels

#### Chapter 1 - Is Daddy Coming With Us?, 1982
- Childhood viewpoints of both Wes', and major live events involving their fathers - one who experienced their father die from a hospital's misdiagnosis, and the other meeting their father for the first time.
- What stood out was that both Wes' had siblings from other fathers.
- For Wes' father who died - Did the hospital misdiagnose out of negligence? Or out of prejudice of seeing an unkempt (unshaven) man, or his race? Didn't seem to be an accident, but rather negligence, given the hospital's askance demeanor toward Wes' father.

#### Chapter 2 - In Search of Home, 1984
- Contrasting stories of their time playing childhood sports and massive differences.
    - Other Wes while playing football, and his brother's guidance to never let anyone disrespect him, resulted in him being overly aggressive playing ball, which let to a fight, which escalated in Other Wes running home to grab a knife, which got him arrested.
    - Wes, on the other hand, despite the dire drug situation in his neighborhood, found a communal and neutral ground on the basketball court where all young men, no matter their background, played ball.
- Thoughts of nature vs nurture. Other Wes' upbringing by his older brother Tony, was the wrong advice, and led him down the wrong path.

#### Chapter 3 - Foreign Ground, 1987
- Wes attends a private school and has conflicted feelings - too “rich” for his neighborhood friends, too “poor” for his school. Wes tried to switch up his style to accommodate for his lack of outfits, even borrowing clothes from Nikki at times. He didn't resort to drugs however, only dealt with those feelings.
- Other Wes gets involved with drug dealers and gets a job as a police lookout, discovers marijuana and ponders selling it. Seems to have been influenced by Tony, with his new clothes, and Other Wes’ own negative feelings of wearing second-hand clothes.

### Part II - Choices and Second Chances

#### Chapter 4 - Marking Territory, 1990
- Tony, Other Wes' older brother, confronts him about his newfound wealth, then beats him for dealing. Other Wes' Mom finds his drugs.
- Other Wes' mom asks a good question, who was to blame here? His friends, her?
- Wes gets caught vandalizing but is let go by police, however he continues to graffiti, as Other Wes' continues to deal.

#### Chapter 5 - Lost, 1991
- Wes at military school. Tried to escape but sgt gave him fake directions. Plebes refer to them in the third person. Lots of money from family, even friends, went into sending Wes to military school. Wes describes his admiration for Captain Hill.
- Other Wes finds out he’s going to be a father. Later on, shoots another kid and gets arrested. He was angry that the kid beat him up. Earlier, he meets his father, and author remarks that “his nonexistent relationship with his father probably contributed to his seeming indifference about becoming a father himself.” Pg. 101
    - But there are kids all over that grow up without father’s, perhaps it was his negative relationship with his father, rather than a lack of a relationship that contributed to him not wanting to be a father himself. Case in point - Wes didn’t have a father either, however did go to military school and perhaps had father figures there.

#### Chapter 6 - Hunted, 1994
- Other Wes gets arrested for a small drug deal despite seeing red flags that indicated the guy was a cop (or working for the cops).
- Wes encounters racism outside the military school.

### Part III - Paths Taken and Expectations Fulfilled

Realizes that his home problems (providing money for his four kids from 2 different mothers, two of which his Mom was taking care of) - and turns back to making drugs

#### Chapter 8 - Surrounded, 2000
- Other Wes arrested for involvement in a jewelry store robbery that ended in a off-duty cop being killed. Claims he was never there, but was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.
