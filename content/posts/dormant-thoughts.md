I'm looking at the date of my last post - January 2021.

Quite a long time ago. With other priorities, this site fell by the wayside. Bianca gave birth to our first child earlier this year and our lives changed. Parenting is as difficult as it is rewarding, and I wouldn't want it any other way. Our days and nights are filled with so much love. 

As I acclimate to this role as a new dad, I'm finding time for my other interests again - writing being one of them.

I'm revisiting drafts from the past year, unpublished thoughts lying dormant in my mind. Topics include IVF, a few books I read, my first month as a father. 

I had bigger priorities, yes. But why didn't I post anything? Nothing at all?

The answer is that I was chasing perfection in my writing. Thinking I'd need to find the perfect way to capture my emotions leading up to the birth of our child, or on IVF, or on something as simple as notes on the book I just read. I found myself in an endless loop of rewriting and overthinking. Energy spent that didn't amount to more writing, as evidenced by the gap in time from my last post.

This piece of writing itself isn't perfect either. I've already spent some time editing and still see ways I can improve on it. But I'm getting used to the idea that this is a process. That I can write out my thoughts, spend a reasonable amount of time editing, post, then move on to the next piece. 

The only way to achieve my goal of writing more is to do just that.
